CODING FOR LED…
The source code is uploaded in GitHub repository.

The things we discussed in the video:
Memory Maps
Block Diagram
Registers
Coding


EXPLANATION:
Memory Maps: Memory maps are just table of peripherals and their starting-ending addresses. The starting address is also called the Base Address.
Block Diagram: These diagrams show the anatomy of the MCU.
Registers: Registers are used for storing data in the form of binary.

Coding:
In coding, we followed the following steps:
Make the pointer variables pointing to the addresses which we are using.
Use the pointer variables to set or reset the bits present on the location.
Enable the clock access.
Set the mode to output.
Set the pin number 14 (PD14) in order to turn on the LED.

Troubleshooting Tips:
Check if your addresses initialized to the pointers are correct or not.
Check if you have enabled the clock access and to the right port.
Check if you have set the mode as output.
Check if the bit you have set in the ODR is correct or not.

THAT’S IT

Structures Notes: (copyright reserved At A Glimpse)   

1] Structures are just a group of variables which have different data types.    

 2] The two similarities between arrays and structures are:   

       a. They can store many values   

        b. They have consecutive memory addresses.   

3] The differences between arrays and structures are:  
Arrays create separate memory sections whereas structures have different variables. (Refer refer point (7) for brief explanation)  

  
4] To define a variable of a structure in C, you will have to follow this format:    
-> struct (name of structure) (name of variable)   

 5] To access the elements of a structure, you will have to follow this:   
-> (name of variable).(name of variable to be accessed)   

 6] Structures are used in embedded systems to make virtual memory maps.  

 7] Brief Explanation:
 See, structures are just a group of variables, but arrays are a group of values. 
 There is only 1 variable of array but there are many variables in a structure. 
 The 1 variable of the array has different memory sections of consecutive addresses but the structures have different variables with consecutive memory addresses.
